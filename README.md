# Ying-et-al-2023

This repository contains the data and code that support the key findings presented in the paper titled “Grid cell disruption in a mouse model of early Alzheimer’s disease reflects reduced integration of self-motion cues” by Ying et.al. Code was written in MATLAB.

## Installing and executing the code
- Positional and spike data (without LFP) is provided in "session_data" and "session_data2" (1320 recording sessions in total). 
- All raw code to generate findings and main figures for each figure are provided in their respective main figure folders (i.e. Figure_1, Figure_2, etc). 
- Code to generate supplementary figures that are directly relevant to their main figure counterparts will appear in the main figure folders.
- The code, particularly in Figures 2 and 3, takes a long time to run. If you'd just like copies of the workspaces obtained from running the code, message me directly. The workspaces have not been uploaded b/c of github file size restrictions. 

###### Dependencies
Code was written in MATLAB 2021b. If there is an error, try to upgrade your version first.
